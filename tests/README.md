# `cuentitos` compatibility tests

Here you can find all the compatibility tests.

The idea is that you can use all these tests along with the provided `compat` tool to test your own `cuentitos` runtime.

This serves me as a way to document how all the features of the environment should work and interact, and to make sure that any bugs that are captured during development are not reintroduced in the future.
