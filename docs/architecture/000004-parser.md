## Change Log

- 2025-01-20 - [First Draft of ADR created](https://github.com/hiddenpeopleclub/cuentitos/pull/52).

## Context

Cuentitos needs a fast and efficient parser to define the language grammar and
generate the necessary structures to be executed at runtime.

In version 0.2 we used PEST, a parser generator for Rust that allowed us to
define the language grammar and generate a parser that was responsible for
transforming the source code into a data structure that we could easily translate
into Rust code.

The main problem with PEST is that it was not easy to modify and extend the
language grammar, and it was not easy to maintain.

Thinking about the possibility of extending the language in the future through
plugins, it is necessary that the parser be easy to extend and maintain.

## Proposed Design

I will start by implementing a very simple parser: it will go line by line
through the script, and asking a list of possible classes if they can parse the
line. If a class can parse the line, the class is responsible for parsing it and
returning an object that represents the line.
