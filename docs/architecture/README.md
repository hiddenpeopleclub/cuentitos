# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the `cuentitos` environment.

Every time I make a design decision, I write an ADR. This is the place to look for the rationale behind the design.

Each ADR is stored in a Markdown file in this directory. The files are named according to the following convention:

```
NNNNNN-title.md` where `NNNNNN` is a zero-padded sequence number for the ADR, and `title` is a short dash-separated description of the change.
```

Any pull request to the `cuentitos` environment that affects the design of the system must include one or more ADRs.

We use the EdgeX Foundry [ADR template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/tree/main/locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-by-edgex)
