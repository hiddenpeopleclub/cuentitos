cuentitos is a game narrative engine with probability in its core.

The `compatibility-tests` folder includes all the tests that explain how the engine should work.

The command `./bin/run-compat` runs these compatibility tests to see if everything is working correctly.

We use Test Driven Development by first writing a compatibility test, having it fail, then implement the feature, and having it pass.
