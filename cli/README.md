# `cuentitos` command line interface

This is a reference implementation of a CLI for `cuentitos`.

The goal of this command line interface is:
1. Run compatibility tests against the runtime
2. Integrate `cuentitos` with a build pipeline without additional dependencies.
3. Develop a `cuentitos` script in the console without additional dependencies.
4. Run tests for your custom `cuentitos` script
